Hey there, Bruins! Here's a quick tip from
your friends at the Powell library

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:09.360
Inquiry labs. First tip: mapping your
research ideas. Creating a map of your

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.019
research ideas is a strategy you can use
whenever you need to figure out your

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.949
paper topic or come up with a list of
possible research questions. It's also

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.140
handy when you need to narrow or broaden the topic of your paper. To get started,

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.119
grab a blank piece of paper and a pen or
pencil. First, draw a circle in the middle

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.050
of the page and write your idea for
paper topic inside. If you're not sure

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.110
what to write, you can start by
connecting your class or assignment with

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.579
something you're passionate about.
You can pause the video here and take a

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.260
few minutes to write down your topic.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.750
Next, think about all the questions you
have about your topic. What are you

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.510
curious about? What would you like to
know? As you brainstorm, try to use a

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.800
variety of questions, words, and phrases.

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.500
You can pause the video here and take a
few minutes to write down as many

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.060
questions as possible about your topic.

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.280
Next, look for a section of your question
map that looks particularly interesting

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.470
to you and try adding new questions to
this section. Note that you can quickly

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:23.840
narrow your topic by focusing on themes. For example, cultural aspects, geographic

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:31.590
areas, groups of people,
and time spans or historical events. 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.910
At this point, focus on asking specific
questions to narrow your topic. Let your

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:41.890
curiosity lead the way. Pause the video
again and take another few minutes to

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.060
add new questions to the page.

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.310
Now look at your map and the questions
you've asked. You probably have quite a

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:56.160
few possibilities to consider. By
choosing keywords and concepts from your

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:01.090
map, you can formulate your ideas into
the question you want to explore.

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:06.250
So what's next? Here are just a few ideas.
First, take another look at your

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.910
assignment. Which of your questions do
you think best addresses the prompt? Of

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.530
these, which questions are you most
passionate about exploring? Once you

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.340
choose a section of the map to focus on,
you can use keywords and phrases to

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.849
search in Google Scholar or an article
database to see what specific

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:27.160
conversations researchers are having
about your topic. Finally, you may want to

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.120
check with your instructor to see if a
topic is too narrow, too broad, or just

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:37.180
right. Want help with the next step?
